         <h3>Physics</h3>
          <p>I enjoy studying and solving physics problems during my free time, especially analytical problems
            that require logical reasoning and mental visualization. This hobby has enhanced my systematic thinking,
            improved my ability to connect theoretical concepts with real-world scenarios, and deepened my understanding 
            of natural phenomena.

         <h3>sport-basketball</h3>
          <p>I have participated in school basketball competitions, which have helped me improve both physically and mentally.
          Through this sport, I have developed teamwork, strategic thinking, and communication under pressure—skills that 
          are essential in both academic and real-life contexts.

               <h3>Circuit Design</h3>
               <p> I participated in an engineering preparation camp where I was able to design and assemble electronic circuits by 
            myself. This hands-on experience allowed 
            me to gain a solid understanding of how circuits work and to help my peers complete their projects as well.
            In addition, I joined the Physics Olympiad training camp (POSN), where I worked collaboratively with teammates to
             build and troubleshoot circuits, supporting
             others in understanding the function of each component and contributing to the success of group activities.
                </p>

               <div>
               <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
               <p>During the engineering camp and POSN camp, I often took the initiative to question problems in depth, analyze given
             data, and propose logical solutions. 
            These experiences enhanced my ability to make thoughtful decisions and helped me support others in understanding 
            problem-solving strategies and processes.

              <div>
            <h3>Communication Skills / Teamwork & Collaboration</h3>
            <p> I competed in a science talent competition as part of a three-person team. Effective communication was critical, 
            particularly during the hands-on 
            experiment phase, where tasks had to be divided and coordinated efficiently under time constraints and pressure. 
            Clear and mutual communication played 
            a key role in our success and allowed us to advance to the next round.</p>
